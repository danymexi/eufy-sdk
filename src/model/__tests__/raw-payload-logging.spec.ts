/**
 * A Raw-DP property is not a misdeclared one.
 *
 * Every structured payload on the clean line is declared by what its getter ANSWERS — nine consumable
 * counters are `"number"` over one base64 string, because a caller asking for hours gets a number. The
 * value must reach storage untouched all the same, and it does: a non-numeric string cannot be coerced
 * to a number, so it passes through. What used to happen is that the pass-through was announced as a
 * mistake, once per property per push — which is how a warning that means something goes unread.
